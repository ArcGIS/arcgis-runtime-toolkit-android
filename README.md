Hiding instructions as AAR is not yet published to Bintray and will not be published to Bintray when 100.6.0 is released.

## Instructions

Update the project Gradle repositories in the **Project** view under **Gradle Scripts > build.gradle (Project:...)** to Esri's Bintray maven repository URL.

```groovy
allprojects {
  ...
  repositories {
    ...
    // *** ADD ***
    maven {
      url 'https://esri.bintray.com/arcgis'
    }
```

Update the app module Gradle dependencies in the **Project** view under **Gradle Scripts > build.gradle (Module: app)** to include the **ArcGIS Runtime Toolkit Android** dependency.

dependencies {
  ...
  // *** ADD ***
  implementation "com.esri.arcgisruntime:arcgis-android-toolkit:100.6.0"
}

```
-->

## Build the Toolkit AAR
