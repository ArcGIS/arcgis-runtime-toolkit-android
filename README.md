# ArcGIS Runtime Toolkit Android

[![doc badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/Doc-purple)](Documentation) 

The ArcGIS Runtime Toolkit for Android contains views that you can use with [ArcGIS Runtime SDK for Android](https://developers.arcgis.com/android/).

You can use the Toolkit in your projects by:

1. **Reference from Jfrog** - the fastest way to get toolkit into your app
    * Ensure the Esri public Jfrog Maven repository is in your project's gradle file - `https://esri.jfrog.io/artifactory/arcgis`

    ```
    allprojects {
    	repositories {
    		...
    		maven { url 'https://esri.jfrog.io/artifactory/arcgis' }
    		...
    	}
    }
    ```

    * Add the toolkit dependency to the module's gradle file 

    ```
    dependencies {
    	implementation 'com.esri.arcgisruntime:arcgis-android-toolkit:100.10.0'
    }
    ```

2. **[Build from source](Documentation/setup.md)** - do this if you want to customize the toolkit

    ```groovy
    $ ./gradlew clean assembleDebug --info
    ```

See the [setup instructions](Documentation/setup.md) for a more detailed guide.

## Features

* **[ArcGISArView](Documentation/AugmentedReality)** - Integrates SceneView with ARCore to enable augmented reality (AR)
* **[Bookmarks](Documentation/Bookmarks)** - Displays the bookmarks present in a map
* **[Compass](Documentation/Compass)** -  Shows the current orientation of a map or scene by displaying a compass icon that points towards North
* **[Scalebar](Documentation/Scalebar)** - Displays the representation of an accurate linear measurement on a map

## Requirements

The toolkit requires the ArcGIS Runtime SDK for Android. Refer to the Instructions section above if you are using Gradle.
See [this guide](https://developers.arcgis.com/android/latest/guide/install-and-set-up.htm) for complete instructions and
other options for installing the SDK.

The following table shows which versions of the SDK are compatible with the toolkit:

|  SDK Version  |  Toolkit Version  |
| --- | --- |
| 100.6.0 | 100.6.0 |
| 100.6.0 | 100.6.1 |
| 100.7.0 | 100.7.0 |
| 100.8.0 | 100.8.0 |
| 100.9.0 | 100.9.0 |
| 100.10.0 | 100.10.0 |
